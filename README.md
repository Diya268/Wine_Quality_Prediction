# Wine_Quality_Prediction

 Wine Quality Prediction Project 

Initiated a wine quality prediction endeavor using Python and machine learning techniques as part of my internship at Edutech Technohacks under the guidance of Sandip Gavit. Employed a Kaggle dataset comprising various wine attributes to train and validate the model. Through meticulous analysis and experimentation, developed a robust predictive model capable of determining wine quality accurately. This project helped me improve my analytical skills and understanding the intricacies of predictive modeling.
